# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This is a fun and interactive game where you can test your guessing skills against a computer-generated number. The game has two exciting modes, each offering a different gameplay experience.

## Features

### 1. Always Random Mode

- In this mode, the game generates a new random number between **2 to 10** every time you guess wrong.
- Your objective is to guess the target number correctly to win the game!
- If you input an invalid number (outside the range), the game will prompt you to enter a valid guess.

### 2. Steady Guessing Game Mode

- In this mode, the game generates a random number between **2 to 20** at the start and keeps it constant throughout your guessing attempts.
- The game provides hints based on your guesses:
  - If your guess is too low, you will be prompted to increase your value.
  - If your guess is too high, you will be prompted to decrease your value.
- As with the random mode, input validation ensures you stay within the allowed range.
