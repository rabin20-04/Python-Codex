# Hangman Game

This is a text-based **Hangman Game** built in Python. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. You can choose from various categories, and the player guesses one letter at a time until they either reveal the word or run out of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Choose a category from the four available options.

2. Players will be presented with a hidden word represented by underscores (`_`). Guess the correct letters by typing them one by one.

3. For each incorrect guess, the hangman drawing advances. You have 7 incorrect guesses before the game ends!

4. If you guess all letters correctly before the hangman drawing is complete, you win!
